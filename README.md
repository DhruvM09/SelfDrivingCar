# 🏎️ Self-Driving Car Simulator (Vanilla JavaScript + Canvas)

An interactive **browser-based self-driving car simulator** built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript** and **HTML Canvas**.  
It demonstrates how **artificial neural networks** can be evolved using a **genetic algorithm with mutation** to enable autonomous driving behavior — all without external machine learning libraries.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Pure Vanilla JS** – no external frameworks or ML libraries.  
- **Canvas-based rendering** for real-time road, car, and obstacle simulation.  
- **Neural network from scratch** – forward propagation, activation functions, and bias handling.  
- **Genetic algorithm with mutation** to evolve driving strategies across generations.  
- **Interactive UI controls**:
  - Adjust mutation rate  
  - Save/discard trained models  
  - Restart simulation  
  - Run multiple cars simultaneously  
- 📊 **Live visualization** of the neural network, including weights, activations, and outputs.
